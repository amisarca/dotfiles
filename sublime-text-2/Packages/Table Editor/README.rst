Settings
--------

By default table editor is available for all syntaxes. In most cases it is what you want, but for some cases it is not that you want. There are 2 approach to fix this
- disable table editor for some specific syntaxes
- disable table editor for all syntaxes and enable for some specific syntaxes

**Disable table editor for some specific syntaxes**

The example of unwanted table recognition is if you are typing next java code
::
    if ( long condition
        |
And then click *Tab* key you get unexpected code
::
    if ( long condition
        |   |
That happens, because SublimeTableEditor think about single character '|' as about a table.
You can get rid from this if set *disable_auto_table_edit=True* for Java syntax specific setting - Java.sublime-setting. For create Java.sublime-settings just click *Preferences -> Setting - More -> Syntax Specific - User*,
when you edit Java file. This example of content Java.sublime-settings
::
    {
        disable_auto_table_edit:true 
    }

**Disable table editor for all syntaxes and enable for some specific**

Other approach is set disable_auto_table_edit=true for user settings, click *Setting - User* to open user setings. Then enable only for specific syntax like Markdown, Textiles, Text etc.

Testing
-------

I tested **SublimeTextEditor** package under Windows and quickly tested under Linux. It should work under Mac, but I did not test, because I do not have a mac.

Film
----
Press ctrl+x, ctrl+t and sublime show for you demo in new scratch view(just close this view after finish). It is integration test and demo at the same time. 

---------
Alignment
---------

By default text data is left justified, numeric data is right justified, column header is centered.
::
    |     column 1     |      column 2      |
    |  second line 1   |   second line 2    |
    |------------------|--------------------|
    | text value row 1 | 0.9999999999999999 |
    | tv row 2         |                 99 |

But you can explicit set justification with format characters '<','>','#'. 
::
    | column 1 | column 2 | column 3 |
    | <<<<<<<< | >>>>>>>> | ######## |
    |----------|----------|----------|
    | 1        |    row 1 |    c1    |
    | 2        |    row 2 |    c2    |
    | 3        |    row 3 |    c3    |


You can change justification several times
::
    | column 1 | column 2 | column 3 |
    | <<<<<<<< | >>>>>>>> | ######## |
    |----------|----------|----------|
    | 1        |    row 1 |    c1    |
    | 2        |    row 2 |    c2    |
    | 3        |    row 3 |    c3    |
    | ######## | <<<<<<<< | >>>>>>>> |
    |    1     | row 1    |       c1 |
    |    2     | row 2    |       c2 |
    |    3     | row 3    |       c3 |

Difference from emacs org-mode table editor
-------------------------------------------

SublimeTableEditor is very similar to emacs org-mode table editor with the same key binding. In fact I always run emacs and compare with Sublime Text Editor to get the same behavior.

But exists some differences. Most significant is Emacs use character '+' in separator line, sublime text editor use character '|'.

Emacs table:
::
    
    | col 1  | col2   | col3   |
    |--------+--------+--------|
    | data 1 | data 2 | data 3 |

Sublime text editor table:
::
    | col 1  |  col2  |  col3  |
    |--------|--------|--------|
    | data 1 | data 2 | data 3 |

I am more interested add support markup specific syntaxes, for example reStructured grid tables than get rid from this difference.

---------------
Missed features
---------------

Bellow syntaxes is not supported by table editor
::
    /*
    * | column 1 | column 2 |
    * |----------|----------|
    * | cell 11  | cell 12  |
    * | cell 21  | cell 22  |
    */
The workaround is use
::
    /*
     | column 1 | column 2 |
     |----------|----------|
     | cell 11  | cell 12  |
     | cell 21  | cell 22  |
    */
But it is nice to have direct support language specific comments.

Know Issues
-----------

Move row up , move row down work correct only for single selection and doesn't work properly for multiple selection.
This will be fixed for GA version.
